# CMPS2212 – Lab #3: The `this` Keyword & DOM Manipulation

This lab explores how JavaScript’s `this` keyword behaves inside DOM event handlers.

## Exercises
1. Multi-Button Highlight using `this`
2. Data Attribute Reader using `this.dataset`
3. Counter App using `.bind()` to preserve object context
4. Debugging an arrow function using `event.currentTarget`

Each exercise was completed on its own Git branch and merged into main.

## How to Run
Open `index.html` in a browser and uncomment one script at a time for testing.
